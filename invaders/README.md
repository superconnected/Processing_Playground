#Invaders

A fun little toy that randomly generates pixelated creatures similar to Space Invaders sprites. Half of the sprite is randomly generated, then mirrored horizontally to produce a complete creature.  

For higher resolutions (that is, larger row and column sizes and smaller cell sizes) a more sophisticated algorithm would probably be better, but for these low resolution sprites a simple call to random() produces a surprising variety of interesting creatures.
